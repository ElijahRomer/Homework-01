HTML/ CSS Code Refactor.

In this activity, I was able to replace standard div elements within the HTML doc to semantic elements to increase accessibility. Through this process, I was able to eliminate several redundant class names and repeat stylings of similar elements within the CSS stylesheet by switching to directly targeting the semantic tags. This shaved over 50 lines off the original CSS document while simultaneously improving readability of the document and leaving original styling completely intact.
